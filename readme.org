The EWS configuration follows the following principles:
 
- Stay as close as humanly bearable to vanilla GNU Emacs
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code (~prog-mode~)
- Centred around Org mode

If you like to support my work, then please purchase the EWS book from your [[https://books2read.com/u/4NpgQ9][favourite e-book retailer]]. The Org mode source code of the whole book is available in the =documents= folder.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.

* Install EWS
To install the EWS configuration, download the =init.el= and =ews.el= files from the GitHub repository and save them in the configuration folder.

The location of the configuration folder depends on your operating system and Emacs version. Type =C-h v user-emacs-directory= to identify its location in the popup help buffer. You can close this buffer by pressing =q=.

Copy both files from the EWS repository to this directory. EWS will activate after you evaluate the ~restart-emacs~ function or the next time you start the program.

If you an experienced Emacs user, then you can try the EWS configuration by cloning this repository and start Emacs with =emacs --init-directory <folder-path>=. That way you can try EWS without clobbering your existing configuration.

* External Packages
Emacs is not only a text editor but also an interface to other software. EWS depends on external software that Emacs interfaces with to do various tasks.

When EWS starts, a message will appear in the =*Messages*= buffer listing the missing software. Some of the listed packages are alternatives for each other, for example (=convert= or =gm=). The core functionality of Emacs will work fine without these, but some specialised tasks require assistance from this software.
